  hypothesis: {
  Coding in an interview is something a significant number of talented software developers will fail at because the test produces extra false negative and rare true positive results.  There is a better way.
  	}
  </div>
  <pre><code>
  experiment 1: {
  The interview team conducts interviews of current employee developers (like you!) and assesses them with sample coding problems.
  	contexts: [
  			whiteboard: The developer demonstrates writing sample code
  				standing at the whiteboard.
  			text editor: The developer demonstrates writing sample code
  				in notepad at the interview room computer.
  			in IDE: The developer demonstrates writing sample code
  				in a familiar IDE but on the interview room computer while the interview team observes and comments on what they are doing, sometimes asking questions, then apologising for interrupting the train of thought followed by a long awkward silence.
  			in their own IDE at their own desk: The developer demonstrates
  writing sample code using their own tools including internet access and use of online documentation and forums.
  		]
  	results: [
  			whiteboard: 91% of develpers failed the task while
  					standing at the whiteboard.  The interview team noted
  					expressions of discomfort, fatigue, confusion, panic.
  					This context produced the worst results of experiment 1.  One subject remarked that in all their years working here they had not needed to do this before and felt concerned if this was going to be something they needed to do regularly (looking at you, Butch).
  text editor: 66% of develpers failed the task while
  					writing in notepad.
  in IDE: 33% of develpers failed the task while
  					working in a familiar IDE.  In a related experiment, 33% of bmx racers failed a 20 meter dash timed trial when using an unfamiliar bike that didn't fit them.
  in their own IDE at their own desk: 100% of developers succeeded in 			completing the task with their own tools including 			internet access and use of online documentation and 			forums.  [giffy "yes!"]

  alternative: {
  	Perform the technical assessment portion of the interview by discussing recent original sample code the developer brings to the interview as a portfolio of representative work.
  }
  This has been a persuasive essay in the form of audience-self-selective, autonomous, viral pseudo code replacing the practice of requesting demonstrative coding in an interview with a practice of discussing original sample code which the developer brings.
