# Default Network (TTAI)

A default network is the mind's background circuitry, the set of connections
that hum along when nothing in particular is being demanded of you. It is the
system's idle state: not empty, just unguided.

## What it does while "nothing" is happening
- Replay memories, especially social or emotional ones
- Simulate futures, run what-ifs, rehearse conversations
- Weave narratives about the self: who you are, where you've been, where you might go
- Connect distant ideas in loose, associative ways

## Why it exists
- Maintains continuity of identity over time
- Integrates experiences into stories rather than raw facts
- Enables creativity by letting ideas collide without supervision
- Keeps models of other people running even when they're not present

## When it helps, when it hurts
- Helpful: creativity, insight, empathy, long-term planning
- Unhelpful: rumination, anxiety loops, getting lost in thought when focus is needed

## A broader pattern
- Computers idle with background services running
- Cities maintain infrastructure even at night
- Social systems preserve norms when no one is actively enforcing them

A default network is what a complex system does when it is free to be itself.
